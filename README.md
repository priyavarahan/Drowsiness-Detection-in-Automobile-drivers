# Drowsiness-Detection-in-Automobile-drivers

Developed an advanced drowsiness detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Viola-Jones, Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG19), and You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3), achieving a 97% accuracy rate in real-time facial feature analysis and fatigue detection. Processed and transformed the NITYMED dataset using Python and TensorFlow, implementing a robust data pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Demonstrated proficiency in deep learning, computer vision, and real-time detection, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to enhance road safety by reducing accidents caused by driver drowsiness.
